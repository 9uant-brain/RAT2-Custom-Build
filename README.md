# RAT2-Custom-Build
## Introduction
The RAT 2 is an effect pedal that was first released in the 1970s and 80s. 
Despite its age, it remains incredibly popular today. Its enduring appeal, especially for beginners in pedal building, stems from its simple circuit design, which makes it an ideal for my first project.
For this project, all design work was carried out using KiCad, an open-source EDA software.
